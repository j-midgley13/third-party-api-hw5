# Third-Party-API Homework 5
--------------
## Introduction
--------------
This assignment I was tasked with building a simple daily calendar using jQuery. Able to tell what hour you are in and save notes for the hours of a business day.
## Criteria
-------------
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
<br>
WHEN I open the planner
<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
<br>
WHEN I scroll down
<br>
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
<br>
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
<br>
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
<br>
WHEN I click into a timeblock
<br>
THEN I can enter an event
<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
<br>
WHEN I refresh the page
<br>
THEN the saved events persist

## Summary
------------
This assignment was another tough one! I recieved help and the code I felt I was doing was just close to copying. I didn't feel right about it especially because I didn't understand the code I was doing. I almost started from scratch and made it more my own. I got it to format correctly and get into the local storage.
